What even is it? I just wish moby was around.  \n<< wait 1000 >> << clearWindowText >> \nThey used to say: \n\"its ok to play the games with other people, to say the one thing so then they say another, its ok. but always remember: we are all always together in the game.  its just a game, but its all we have and all that brings us together\"\n<< wait 2000 >>  << clearWindowText >> \n(i should go play card games. even those things i feel like I know what they meant.  the cards are my friends, i like them a lot).\n<< wait 1000 >>  << clearWindowText >> \nI like the lil cards because they are small and dignified.  I like those kinds of things.  Like a cherry, or a pistachio.  Like the bicycle in the traffic, the squirrel in the park.  \n<< zoomCamera 6 30000 >> \nThey exist as a kinda joke, but one that no one can laugh at.  and the joke is not rly funny, but more just... looks like a joke I guess.  \n<< wait 2000 >>  << clearWindowText >> \ndid moby talk about jokes ever? I heard maik say a joke he supposedly heard from moby but theyre probably lieing.  it was like: \n\"with enough broken clocks, you always know the time\"\n<< wait 2000 >>  << clearWindowText >> \nbut that seems dumb.  unless you arranged the clocks in the order they were broken, and had a good distribution of times.  then you could turn a lil every five minutes and that would be the time.  \n<< wait 500 >>\nnot one long line of time, but just... one space where things have been set up and time is set in motion.\n<< wait 2000 >>  << clearWindowText >> \nwatches can be small and dignified. the mushroom.\na small glass, with some scented toothpicks.\na tree branch, inside a wine bottle, set in the middle of the campfire\nthe single mole on the face.\n<< wait 2000 >>  << clearWindowText >> \nmoby also said: \n\"to talk about those bad bad things back then, we can't ever talk about them 'how they were'.  we gotta just instead take the whole moment all at once, and only when we are already in trouble.  we can't talk about it from here, only talk about it once we share something with it, that we become aware that we are just the same thing as the 'how-they-were' things, just one thing\"\n<< clearWindowText >> << wait 700 >>  One game? \n<< wait 1000 >>  << clearWindowText >> \n\"no, not a game this time, just the thing that, if we start feeling so accomplished that we made it *through* something, they will just take it all back.  no more city, no more drugs. no more lazy-times.  it will be like it was: like the old city and old drugs and old times\"\n<< wait 2000 >>  << clearWindowText >>\n\"it is all one time, but not in the same way it is all one game.  bc time is always about danger, about the '\none-day-things-will-be-different,' as soon as you say that they will win, the someday is today in a different color, not a different place; and games are about being together, even its together with the game\"\n<< wait 2000 >>  << clearWindowText >>\nMaybe maik did hear that joke from moby...",
